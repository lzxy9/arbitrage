# web scraping
scrape odds from bookie websites

# calculate odds
in every case where you can cover all outcomes with bets (so 2-3 outcomes, like less than 30 points scored or 30points or more) take the highest odds you're offered by each booker for each category, and if their sum is less than 1 there's an arbitrage to be made

# further computation
for a given stake, compute what the bets should be to exploit that arbitrage.
